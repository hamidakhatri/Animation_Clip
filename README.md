# Animation_Clip


This project demonstrates the creation of animation clips using Unityâ€™s keyframe animation system. It is designed as part of a learning exercise to familiarize with Unity Engine's keyframe animation techniques. The main feature is a "pulsing" animation for fireflies (point lights) in the forest portion of an isometric adventure scene.

Features

- Keyframe Animation: Creating animations by defining keyframes for the most important frames of an action.
- Tweening: Using Unity's built-in system to automatically compute the frames in between the keyframes.
- Looping Animation: Ensuring the animation loops and plays automatically when the game enters play mode.
- Realistic Variations: Making each firefly's animation slightly different for a more realistic effect.

Implementation

- Creating Keyframe Animation: Producing keyframes to define the starting and ending points of the fireflies' pulsing effect.
- Utilizing Tweening: Leveraging Unity's system to fill in the frames between keyframes.
- Animating Component Properties: Identifying and animating component properties (e.g., light intensity) to achieve the pulsing effect.
- Ensuring Variations: Adjusting the animation for all four firefly lights to have slight differences for realism.
- Setting Loop and Auto-Play: Configuring the animation to loop and play automatically when the game starts.

The fireflies in the forest portion of the scene will exhibit a realistic pulsing effect, enhancing the overall ambiance and providing a hands-on experience with Unity's keyframe animation system.
